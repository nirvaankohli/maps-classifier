# Upgrade Notes: V2 to V3 Training Pipeline (EuroSAT)

This document explains the planned changes and improvements for the training pipeline, moving from **V2** (`trainingV2.py`) to **V3** (`trainingV3.py`). The goal is to make the EuroSAT classification pipeline even more accurate and reliable, using better data augmentation, improved data splitting, more detailed metrics, and a new model. 

---

## V2 Recap

- **Model**: EfficientNet-B0 (pretrained on ImageNet, early layers frozen, custom classifier head)
- **Data Augmentation**: Extensive (random resized crop, flips, rotation, color jitter, grayscale, affine)
- **Dataset Handling**: Custom `EuroSATDataset` with class-to-index mapping
- **Training Logic**:
  - 80/20 random split for train/val
  - AdamW optimizer, ReduceLROnPlateau scheduler
  - Early stopping (patience=15)
  - Logging to CSV
  - Best model checkpointing
- **EuroSAT Adaptation**: 10 classes, resized to 224x224, ImageNet normalization
- **Visualization**: Confusion matrix and training history plots
- **Model Saving**: Best model and frozen inference model with metadata
- **Result**: Achieved >97% validation accuracy (expected)

## Planned Upgrades for V3

### 1. **Model Architecture**

- **Upgrade**: Switch from EfficientNet-B0 to GoogleLeNet (Inception V1, pretrained on ImageNet), with all layers unfrozen for full fine-tuning and a custom classifier head.

- **Logic**: I expect GoogleLeNet to provide strong performance(more than b0) on satellite imagery due to its inception modules, which capture multi-scale features. Full fine-tuning allows the model to adapt more deeply to EuroSAT's domain.

- **EuroSAT Fit**: The classifier head will be expanded for better transfer learning, and the model will be trained end-to-end.

### 2. **Advanced Data Augmentation & Preprocessing**

- **Upgrade**: Introduce a much more aggressive augmentation pipeline:

  - Wider scale for RandomResizedCrop
  - Higher probability and variety of flips (horizontal, vertical)
  - Larger random rotation angles
  - Stronger ColorJitter
  - Increased RandomGrayscale and RandomAffine
  - Add AutoAugment (ImageNet policy), RandAugment, TrivialAugmentWide, and RandomErasing

- **Logic**: These augmentations will greatly increase the diversity of training data, helping the model generalize to unseen satellite images and reducing overfitting.

### 3. **Dataset Handling & Stratified Splitting**

- **Upgrade**: Move from a simple random split to a stratified split using `StratifiedShuffleSplit` to ensure class balance in train/val sets.
- **Logic**: Stratified splitting will guarantee that all classes are proportionally represented in both training and validation, leading to more reliable evaluation and improved generalization.

### 4. **Metrics & Evaluation**

- **Upgrade**: Expand evaluation metrics to include not just accuracy, but also per-class precision, recall, F1, macro F1, and ROC AUC (where applicable). Save a full classification report and confusion matrix.
- **Logic**: Richer metrics will provide deeper insights into model performance, especially for imbalanced or difficult classes, and will help guide further improvements.

### 5. **Training Enhancements**

- **Upgrade**: Add support for mixed-precision training (AMP) for faster and more memory-efficient training on GPUs.
- **Upgrade**: Use deterministic seeding for all data loader workers for full reproducibility.
- **Logic**: These changes will make training faster, more stable, and fully reproducible.

### 6. **Logging & Visualization**

- **Upgrade**: Continue logging to CSV, but also save all metrics (including confusion matrix and classification report) as JSON for easier downstream analysis.
- **Upgrade**: Generate improved training curves and confusion matrix plots.
- **Logic**: Enhanced logging and visualization will make it easier to analyze, debug, and present results.

### 7. **Other Improvements**

- **Upgrade**: Modularize code further, with clear separation of data, model, training, and evaluation logic.
- **Upgrade**: Prepare for future integration with advanced model libraries (e.g., `timm`) and TensorBoard.
- **Logic**: These changes will make the codebase easier to maintain and extend for future research.

## Expected Impact & Predictions

- **Accuracy**: With a more powerful model (GoogleLeNet), much stronger augmentation, and stratified splitting, V3 is expected to surpass V2's accuracy, potentially reaching or exceeding 98% on the EuroSAT validation set.

- **Generalization**: The aggressive augmentation and stratified split should yield a model that is robust to class imbalance and unseen data.

- **Usability**: Richer metrics, improved logging, and modular code will make the pipeline easier to use, debug, and extend.

- **Maintainability**: The refactored structure and advanced features will facilitate future upgrades and experimentation.
